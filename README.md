Shortboard IS JUST AN IDEA.  No browser here yet.

# What is Shortboard?

Shortboard is a web browser designed with user privacy and control as paramount features.

## Rendering Engine

Shortboard will use the [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo) web rendering engine.
Servo is still in development.  Servo is already more parallel than any other web
rendering engine, and it will likely be the fastest and eventually most stable rendering
engine thanks to the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) language.

## Features

Features will be listed as they arrive.  For intended features, see the Issue Tracking
on github.
